-- We'll also be making a junction table called "track_genres"

-- It will need two columns:
  -- track_id (this is a string)
  -- genre_id (this is an integer)

-- Of course, these need to be foreign keys to the relevant tables

-- Could you write the SQL to set up this junction table?

CREATE TABLE track_genres(
    track_id text,
    genre_id integer,
    foreign key (track_id) references tracks(id),
    foreign key (genre_id) references genres(id)
);
